<title>Hariyali Teej Fasting Rules 2023: Do's and Don'ts during fast</title>
<description>Hariyal Teej is a significant Indian festival for married women, observed on August 19, 2023, in the northern states of India. Women wake up early, take a holy bath, adorn themselves in traditional attire, and offer prayers to Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati for a happy marital life. Hariyal Teej is also celebrated in Radha Krishna temples with grandeur and enthusiasm. Women must not wear black, white, cream, or blue-colored clothes on this auspicious day and mustn't engage in any tamasik activity while following a sattvic lifestyle. Pregnant women can skip the fast but stay hydrated.</description>
