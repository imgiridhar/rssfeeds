      <title>BAD SENDER REPUTATION? HERE'S HOW TO CHECK YOURS AND ULTIMATELY FIX IT</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.mirabelsmarketingmanager.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/5f63abde5442625d8ed8abbc_shutterstock_1570126813-2.jpg" alt="Image Alt Text" /><br />Email is a strong marketing strategy to directly reach your digital audience and keep them informed on product updates, service announcements, special offers, and more.

      <title>WHY VALID EMAIL ADDRESSES ARE ESSENTIAL … AND INVALID ONES CAN BE DANGEROUS!</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.mirabelsmarketingmanager.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/5f6b350e75555227ec430b22_shutterstock_1049177441-1.jpg" alt="Image Alt Text" /><br />In order to create a successful email marketing campaign, you first need a healthy email list full of valid email addresses. It’s important that your message is delivered to legitimate inboxes in order to increase engagement rate, decrease spam complaints and unsubscribes, and more.
A healthy email list helps you avoid any long-term consequences affecting your sender reputation, such as getting blacklisted by inbox providers or falling into phishing scams or honeypot traps. SendInBlue reminds us that a clean email list with valid contacts ensures:To ensure you know how to tell if an email address is valid (as well as how to avoid invalid email addresses), Mirabel’s Marketing Manager will discuss the difference between invalid and valid email addresses.
